              <td>Data Mining and Causal Inference in Finance: Advanced Techniques for Improved Decision-Making</td>
              <td>This course on Data Mining and Causal Inference in Finance covers basic concepts and techniques of data mining for finance data. You will learn best practices for data visualization in causal inference using tables and plots. Regression analysis will be covered, including interpreting regression results and addressing common problems such as standard errors, collinearity, and endogeneity.

                Through hands-on exercises, you will explore how to use causal diagrams to improve your causal inference and how to address confounding using closing back doors and opening front doors. Regression discontinuity analysis, including sharp, fuzzy, and kernel estimation, selection bias, and other issues will also be explored.
                
                You will learn about difference in differences analysis, including estimating the average treatment effect, the two-way fixed effects model, and addressing limitations such as parallel trends and double robust estimation. Imputation methods such as generalized synthetic control and matrix completion will be covered.
                
                Advanced topics in causal inference will include propensity score matching, panel data analysis, and machine learning methods. Join us to discover the power of data mining and causal inference in finance, and learn how to make informed decisions based on the data</td>
